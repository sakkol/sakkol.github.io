I am Serdar Akkol, MD. I graduated Istanbul University, Cerrahpasa School of Medicine in June, 2018. After receiving my medical degree, I started to work with [Dr.Josef Parvizi](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?user=t4XXQ7AAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) as a postdoctoral scholar at [Stanford University](https://med.stanford.edu/neurology.html) until May 2019. To pursue my physician-scientist ideal, I started my PhD with [Dr.Stephan Bickel](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Bickel%2C+Stephan%5BAuthor%5D&sort=) and [Dr.Ashesh Mehta](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?user=Foh8-ewAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
