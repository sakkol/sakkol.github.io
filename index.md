I am Serdar Akkol, MD, an aspiring neurologist-neuroscientist. I am interested how brain produces the immense variety of cognitive processes such as speech perception and mathematical calculations. I would like to apply the knowledge I obtained and produced into the care of patients with neurological diseases and into the improvement of their lives.

I graduated from Istanbul University, Cerrahpa≈üa School of Medicine in June, 2018. After receiving my medical degree, I started to work with [Dr.Josef Parvizi](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?user=t4XXQ7AAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) as a postdoctoral scholar at [Stanford University](https://med.stanford.edu/neurology.html) until May 2019. To pursue my ideal to be a physician-scientist, I started my PhD with [Dr.Stephan Bickel](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Bickel%2C+Stephan%5BAuthor%5D&sort=) and [Dr.Ashesh Mehta](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?user=Foh8-ewAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at [the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research at Northwell Health](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/).

I plan to start my Neurology residency in 2022 as an MD-PhD. Looking forward to [#Match2022](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Match2022)!
