I am Serdar Akkol, MD PhD, an aspiring physician-scientist. I am interested in understanding ["the theater of mind"](http://metaphors.lib.virginia.edu/metaphors/12137){:target="_blank"}. I use neuroimaging and electrophysiological recordings to understand various cognitive processes like language and diseases like epilepsy. I would like to translate the knowledge I obtained and produced into the care of patients with neurological diseases.

I graduated from Istanbul University, Cerrahpa≈üa School of Medicine in June, 2018. After receiving my medical degree, I worked with [Josef Parvizi, MD PhD](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?user=t4XXQ7AAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao){:target="_blank"} as a postdoctoral scholar at [Stanford University](https://med.stanford.edu/neurology.html){:target="_blank"} until May, 2019. To pursue my ideal to become a better physician-scientist, I completed my PhD in June, 2022 under supervision of [Stephan Bickel, MD PhD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Bickel%2C+Stephan%5BAuthor%5D&sort=){:target="_blank"} and [Ashesh Mehta, MD PhD](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?user=Foh8-ewAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao){:target="_blank"} at [the Elmezzi Graduate School of Molecular Medicine](https://www.northwell.edu/education-and-resources/elmezzi-graduate-school-of-molecular-medicine){:target="_blank"} of [the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research at Northwell Health](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/){:target="_blank"} in New York.

Currently, I am a PGY-4 resident of [Neurology Residency Program](https://www.uab.edu/medicine/neurology/education/residency){:target="_blank"} at [the University of Alabama at Birmingham](https://www.uab.edu/home/){:target="_blank"}. I will be an Epilepsy Fellow at [Duke University](https://neurology.duke.edu/divisions/epilepsy-sleep-and-clinical-neurophysiology){:target="_blank"} starting July 2026.
