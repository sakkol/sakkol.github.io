I am Serdar Akkol, MD, an aspiring physician-scientist. I am interested in understanding ["the theater of mind"](http://metaphors.lib.virginia.edu/metaphors/12137){:target="_blank"}. I use neuroimaging and electrophysiological recordings to understand various cognitive processes like language and diseases like epilepsy. I would like to translate the knowledge I obtained and produced into the care of patients with neurological diseases.

I graduated from Istanbul University, Cerrahpaşa School of Medicine in June, 2018. After receiving my medical degree, I started to work with [Josef Parvizi, MD PhD](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?user=t4XXQ7AAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao){:target="_blank"} as a postdoctoral scholar at [Stanford University](https://med.stanford.edu/neurology.html){:target="_blank"} until May 2019. 

To pursue my ideal to be a physician-scientist, I started my PhD under supervision of [Stephan Bickel, MD PhD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Bickel%2C+Stephan%5BAuthor%5D&sort=){:target="_blank"} and [Ashesh Mehta, MD PhD](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?user=Foh8-ewAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao){:target="_blank"} in [Elmezzi Graduate School of Molecular Medicine](https://www.northwell.edu/education-and-resources/elmezzi-graduate-school-of-molecular-medicine){:target="_blank"} at [the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research at Northwell Health](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

My plan is to start my Neurology residency in 2022 as an MD-PhD. Looking forward to [#Match2022](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Match2022){:target="_blank"}!
