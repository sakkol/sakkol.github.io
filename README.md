> Website

This is my personal website, which is based on GitHub pages using Jekyll framework.

It is still under development but there are several websites I kickstarted this:
- https://jekyllrb.com/
- https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now
- https://gist.github.com/roachhd/779fa77e9b90fe945b0c
- https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/1819#issuecomment-89003858
- https://fontawesome.com/
- https://www.kodingmadesimple.com/2015/02/Free-Black-and-White-Social-Media-Icons-CSS-HTML.html
And, of course, some google searches for little things (like to make images wider).

If you want to try it yourself, I'd suggest you to go to [Barry Clark's Jekyll intro](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). It is very useful!
