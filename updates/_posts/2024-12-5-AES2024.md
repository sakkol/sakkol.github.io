title: First AES Annual Meeting 2024
---

It has been a great opportunity to be among the people who care deeply about epilepsy. This was also my first AES meeting, so will have a special importance.

I was fortunate to join the AES & ASSFN Resident Epilepsy Surgery course and to be among the 40 residents who are the future of epilepsy. We started from the basics in the initial classes and advanced to cutting edge techniques. It was especially useful to do small group case discussions that helped us think through the cases and decide on what would be the best case. These discussions emphasized the importance of multi-disciplinary teams in managing the patients. 

I was joined by many of the UAB [residents](https://x.com/uabneurores/status/1866487210616443190){:target="_blank"} and [epilepsy faculty](https://x.com/UABEpilepsy){:target="_blank"}. Listened to the cutting edge clinical and basic science research on epilepsy. One day, I spent about 6 hours walking among the interesting posters on the diverse topics of epilepsy and talking with the presenters. So much to catch up! 

I was able to share our poster on the how anti-seizure medications alter the cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs). We had great feedback from the giants of the field who stopped by the poster. 

Looking forward to next AES meetings!
