title: Completed Philosophy Degree
---
My wife, Ezgi, and I started taking classes offered through [the Open Education Program (Global Campus) of the Anadolu University](https://globalcampus.anadolu.edu.tr/){:target="_blank"}. Well, the journey came to an end and we have obtained our Bachelor's Degree in Philosophy. The program offered us the opportunity to follow a logical and structured path to learn about different philosophical schools, how the philosophers argue about their ideas and what the different ways are to think about a subject or a question. There is always more to learn and not much time. So, shall we continue to explore [the theater of mind](https://metaphors.lib.virginia.edu/metaphors/12137){:target="_blank"} or [be silent for that we cannot speak](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/#TracLogiPhil){:target="_blank"}. I will continue thinking...
