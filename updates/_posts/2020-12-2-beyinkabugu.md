[Beyin Kabugu](https://open.spotify.com/show/474iQXT7JKq7gKrCeMjkHP){:target="_blank"} is run by [Seydanur Tikir](https://twitter.com/shaydanur){:target="_blank"} in an effort to introduce brain sciences to Turkish audience in an understandable way. With Seyda, we talked about the processes involved in language processing, the neural oscillation hypothesis of speech perception and my PhD work on the oscillations and epi/trans-cranial electrical stimulation related to speech perception. It was my first time talking about my research to a larger audience, so very excited about this.
