title: American Neurological Association Futures Program and Annual Meeting 
---

Super honored to be accepted to the [American Neurological Association](https://myana.org/){:target="_blank"} - [Futures Program](https://myana.org/careers/ana-futures-program){:target="_blank"}. This is a year-long career development program for residents and medical students. We had a few meetings on career development and how to prepare your elevator pitch and abstracts. At the ANA 149th Annual Meeting in September 14-17 in Orlando, FL, we listened to a lecture from Dr. Steve Roach on the biomedical writing. We also had a few small-group sessions where we met with the ANA Board and Leadership. 

I have been following the Annals of Neurology and was fascinated by the works published by the prominent people of Neurology. I am very excited for this opportunity and looking forward to meeting the giants in the fields of Neurology and Neurosciences. The most important and the highlight of the meeting for me was to be able to meet with the giants in the field of Neurology and Neuroscience. Listening to cutting edge research... Hearing the thoughts shaping the future... The cherry on top was to meet the brilliant peers across the US and the world - residents, scientists and medical students. 

I also presented our poster on the effects of anti-seizure medications on the cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs). This poster was an update from the previous poster I presented at AAN with an additional patient. Results are still holding up to show that the effects of seizure medications are mostly on the seizure network, but not on the healthy network.  

Will definitely join more ANA meetings!
