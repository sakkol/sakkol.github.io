title: Elmezzi APSA Local Chapter and the Inaugural Event
---

One of my passions and an important addition to our institution have come true: we have established the Local Chapter of American Physician Scientist Association at the Elmezzi Graduate School of Molecular Medicine. As the founding president, I feel very proud of this new initiative. 

Our goal is to increase the visibility of the achievements and challenges of physician-scientists through advocacy and organized events to inspire stronger peer communication and mentorship for physician-scientists by creating the appropriate environment.

We have organized our inaugural event with Dr. Kevin Tracey on 11/11/2021. He talked about his journey in how he became a physician-scientist, his advices to the trainees and the work he has done through the years. He also shared his vision for the future of bioelectronic medicine.
