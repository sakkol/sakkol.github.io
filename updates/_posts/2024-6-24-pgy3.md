title: Starting PGY-3 of Neurology
---
It has been a busy year with learning, repeating, seeing, running, getting excited! PGY2 has definitely taught me a lot, but at the same time, I'm glad to be done.

Now, I start the next stage of my training, the one I have been looking forward for a long time. There will be a lot of learning again, to slowly settle down the clouds of PGY2, doing some more research and starting to plan for the fellowship. I feel thrilled to be here!

I cannot be more grateful to my friends, my co-residents. I always knew how important the friendships are. I cherish every moment I spend with them. These people elevate me to another level (both figuratively and literally)! So we celebrated the end of PGY2 at lake house resting and having fun. I love these people!!
