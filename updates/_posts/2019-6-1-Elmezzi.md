---

I have started my PhD under the supervision of Drs. Stephan Bickel and Ashesh Mehta at [Human Brain Mapping Lab](https://amehtalab.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"} within [the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research at Northwell Health](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/){:target="_blank"} and [North Shore university Hospital](https://nsuh.northwell.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 

In my thesis project, I study the speech perception with a focus on neural oscillations and electrical stimulation using intracranial EEG.
