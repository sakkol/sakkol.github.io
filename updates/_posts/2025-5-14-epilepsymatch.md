title: Matched to Duke Epilepsy Fellowship
---
Very excited that I matched to Duke for my Epilepsy and Clinical Neurophysiology Fellowship!! My top choice <a href="https://neurology.duke.edu/divisions/epilepsy-sleep-and-clinical-neurophysiology" target="_blank"> Duke</a> offers a great clinical education and an amazing environment for research. I will start my 2 year journey there in July 2026. 

I am looking forward to joining an amazing department to pursue my interests. Already started talking with [Dr. Birgit Frauscher](https://www.anphylab.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Gregory Cogan](https://www.coganlab.org/){:target="_blank"} about what research projects I can be involved in. So exciting!
