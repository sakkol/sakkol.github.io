title: New review on the role of physical activity in older adults with epilepsy
---

In this collaborative effort with neuroscientists and neurologists, we explored the role of physical activity in older adults with epilepsy. 

While it's clear that physical activity benefits most adults, the role of physical activity in individual with epilepsy, let alone in older adults with epilepsy, is an important topic to explore and explain given the risks associated with this patient population. However, we found that the evidence for physical activity in older adults with epilepsy remains limited. There is signal that there are unique benefits of physical activity in this patient population, especially towards reducing the risk of falls and neuroinflammation. Physical activity may even reduce the incidence of epilepsy in older adults.
