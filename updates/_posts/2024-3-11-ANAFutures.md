title: Accepted to ANA Futures Program
---
Super honored to be accepted to the [American Neurological Association](https://myana.org/){:target="_blank"} - [Futures Program](https://myana.org/careers/ana-futures-program){:target="_blank"}. This is a year-long career development program for residents and medical students who are invited to the ANA Annual Meeting. This year, [the meeting](https://2024.myana.org/){:target="_blank"} takes place between September 14-17 in Orlando, FL. I hope to join the meeting with a recent work of mine using iEEG (to be annouced soon).

I have been following the Annals of Neurology and was fascinated by the works published by the prominent people of Neurology. I am very excited for this opportunity and looking forward to meeting the giants in the fields of Neurology and Neurosciences.
