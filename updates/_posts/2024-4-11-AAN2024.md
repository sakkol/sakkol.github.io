title: AAN Annual Meeting 2024
---

It has been an amazing 3 days to hang out with the brainiest doctors from around the world. I was post-call and missed the fun reception, but it was a great conference. Lots of learning, connecting and remembering...

I was also lucky to present my poster on the effects of anti-seizure medications on the cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs). I had the unique opportunity to compare the latency and amplitude profiles of N1 and N2 of the CCEPs in two patients with the only difference being the patient's seizure medication status. These preliminary analyses show that the effects of seizure medications are mostly on the seizure network, but not on the healthy network. Althought it is an intuitive result, this type of analyses were not conducted previously. 

Looking forward to the future AAN meetings!!
