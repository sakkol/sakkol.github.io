title: Establishing the Elmezzi APSA Local Chapter
---

A passion of me and an important addition to our institution have come true: we have established the Local Chapter of American Physician Scientist Association at the Elmezzi Graduate School of Molecular Medicine. As the founding president, I feel very proud of this new initiative. 

Our goal is to increase the visibility of the achievements and challenges of physician-scientists through advocacy and organized events to inspire stronger peer communication and mentorship for physician-scientists by creating the appropriate environment.

On this initiative, I am not alone, I work with [Bailey Roberts](https://twitter.com/Baileykrmd){:target="_blank"} (vice president), Santoshi Poonacha (treasurer), Matthew Rice (secretary), [Dane Thompson](https://twitter.com/DaneAThompson1){:target="_blank"} (school of medicine liaison), Akash Mishra (school of medicine liaison) and [Prashin Unadkat](https://twitter.com/PrashinU){:target="_blank"} (webmaster).
We also have a Twitter account(https://twitter.com/APSAElmezzi){:target="_blank"}. And our advisor is [Dr. Annette Lee](https://twitter.com/AnnetteLeePhD){:target="_blank"} who helped us very much and provided ample support to bring this initiative alive.
