title: Published my work on Periventricular Heteropias in Journal of Neuroscience
---

Here, we identified with intracranial EEG that some parts of periventricular heterotopia responds normally to cognitive task, like normal cortical tissue, and also keeps network level integration at rest. I shared a [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/sakkolMD/status/1372190092870189060){:target="_blank"} to summarize the findings and a few cool figures. Full text is published in [Journal of Neuroscience](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2785-20.2021){:target="_blank"}. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2785-20.2021" target="_blank"  class="ai ai-doi ai-lg"></a> This work is my first in US! 

Following is a part of the Figure-1 in which we depicted activities of multiple electrodes to show that only some parts of PVH tissue had activity profile just like salience or dorsal attention network. All 3 cases also had electrodes in normal cortex that had similar activity profile.
