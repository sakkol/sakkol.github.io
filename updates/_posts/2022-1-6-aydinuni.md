title: Gave lecture on speech perception
---
I was invited to talk about the brain mechanisms of speech perception to a group of grad students in the Audiology Department of Istanbul Aydin University, Turkey. 

The lecture included hierarchy of the language and the organization of language processing, basic and advanced processing of speech perception and the major models of language processing. We also discussed their projects and main interests. It was a great experience for me and they seemed to enjoy the lecture too.
