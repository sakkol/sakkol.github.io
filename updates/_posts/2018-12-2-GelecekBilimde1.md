[Gelecek Bilimde](https://gelecekbilimde.net/){:target="_blank"} is a young effort to introduce science and research to young Turkish audience. [Ezgi](https://mobile.twitter.com/ezgisari){:target="_blank"} and I talked with [Burak Cankaya](https://mobile.twitter.com/burakcankaya07){:target="_blank"} about what is a scientific research project, how it starts and evolves, what are different types of research, how to build a lab and a research project, what are required and what factors affect the quality of scientific research. It was a fun conversation and also my first podcast. The recording is on Youtube<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGwEAf9YHqA" target="_blank"  class="fa fa-youtube fa-lg"></a> and can be listened on Spotify <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7EN8mfnve7WukFVLSTc704" target="_blank"  class="fa fa-spotify fa-lg"></a>.
