title: Activated AAN and APAN memberships
---

I have started my memberships in [American Academy of Neurology](https://www.aan.com/){:target="_blank"} and [American Physician Scientists Association](https://www.physicianscientists.org/){:target="_blank"}. 

So proud to be part of both associations. Looking forward to being involved more and advocate for both neurologists and physician-scientists. Why not starting a local chapter!
