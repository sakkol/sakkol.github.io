title: Poster presentation at SfN'2021 (my first SfN!)

I have presented my work virtually with the title of ["Entrainment effects to simple sounds and speech in human auditory cortex revealed by intracranial recordings"](https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/index.html#!/10485/presentation/22167){:target="_blank"}. Although there was some technical problems on the first day, I got the chance to present my work on the 3rd day.

Briefly, we asked whether the neural entrainment lasts longer the simple sounds or the speech. We used the intracranial EEG recordings while participants listened to simple auditory stimuli or stories. We found no evidence of ongoing oscillations at stimulation frequencies outlasting entrainment stimulus presentation for more than one cycle in either Heschl's gyrus (HG) or superior temporal gyrus (STG). However, we found that the acoustic edges of speech did indeed drive theta-alpha band entrainment  and this entrainment outlasted the acoustic stimulation for two cycles in both HG and STG. We think that these results point out the importance of careful consideration of the task and stimulus design in studies examining the presence of neural oscillations outlasting acoustic stimulation.
