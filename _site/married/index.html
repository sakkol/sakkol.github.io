    <p>Ezgi and I started dating in 2017 (although we met long before, in 2013). I see our relationship as a couple who completes each other. We grew together, supported each other no matter what. We were separated by 10 hours of time zone difference while I was in the US and she was in Turkey. It was hard. But we did not put any burden on each other. <a href="https://twitter.com/ezgisari" target="_blank">She</a> is the most fascinating, the funniest and the most understanding person I have ever met.</p>

<p>Although we learned a lot about the world while together, we are still 2 children. So, yes, we had hotdogs after our wedding ceremony in front of the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
