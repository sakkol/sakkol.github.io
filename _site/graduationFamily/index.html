  <h2>Thank you my family and friends</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>While I graduate from my PhD, I contemplated upon how much my family has sacrificied. They allowed me to pursue my interests, although they were able to see me once or twice a year. They always supported and encouraged me about what I want to do. They did this in a way that I felt so lucky. They constantly asked me about my results, my presentations, my papers and my well-being. They did not want me to lock myself into the lab 24h, but wanted me to live my life and enjoy New York City while I can. There is no way to express how much I love them. I made a lot of new friends and continued my long lasting friendships. All of these precious people were happy to share my enthusiasm about my research.</p>

<p>I feel lucky especially because I was able to spend 2 years of my PhD with Ezgi, my dear wife in NY. Her arrival to NY became a turning point for my well-being and sanity. She helped me balance well-being and science with two smiling eyes. She is my best friend!</p>
