I have started my PhD under the supervision of Drs. Stephan Bickel and Ashesh Mehta at [Human Brain Mapping Lab](https://amehtalab.wordpress.com/) within [Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/). 

I study speech perception with a focus on neural oscillations and electrical stimulation using intracranial EEG.
