title: Started Post-doc at Stanford University
---
After I received my medical degree, I started my postdoc with [Dr.Josef Parvizi](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?user=t4XXQ7AAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at [Stanford University](https://med.stanford.edu/neurology.html) in October, 2018. In [Laboratory of Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience (LBCN)](http://med.stanford.edu/parvizi-lab.html), I studied different cognitive functions using human intracranial EEG recordings. 

In one of the projects about the mathematical cognition, I worked with [Dr.Pedro Pinheiro-Chagas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=XVsftdsAAAAJ) to curate one of the largest dataset of mathematical cognition in intracranial EEG. Specifically, I was in charge of the neuroimaging part of the project.

In another exciting project, I worked closely with [Dr.Aaron Kucyi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XJOgVzkAAAAJ&hl=en)
on probing the functional role and the network-level integration of a developmental disorder (periventricular heterotopia) in the patients implanted with intracranial electrodes.
