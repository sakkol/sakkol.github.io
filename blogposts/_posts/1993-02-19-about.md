I was born in Istanbul, Turkey to a very loving family! I have an older brother sharing the same father. I have a 1.5 years younger sister, [Elif](https://www.instagram.com/akkoleliff/){:target="_blank"}, who is almost a twin to me. We shared the same room for 23 years, just like twins, right? We also shared the same classroom and often the same desk for our 9 years, because she started the elementary school earlier than she ought to. So, yes, she is a genius and now a practicing endodontist in Istanbul.
