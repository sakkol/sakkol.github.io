I was born in Istanbul, Turkey to a very loving family! I have an older brother sharing the same father. I have a 1.5 years younger sister, [Elif](https://www.instagram.com/akkoleliff/){:target="_blank"}, who is almost a twin, you'd say. We shared the same classroom for our 9 years and the same room for 23 years. Because she started elementary school early with me. So, yes, she is a genius and now a practicing endodontist in Istanbul.
